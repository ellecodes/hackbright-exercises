A user can log in and view his list
A user must be able to add a new task
A user should be able to mark a task as complete

From this list, we can identify the following nouns and attributes:
User (noun)
	id (attribute)
	email
	password
	name
Task (noun)
	id (attribute)
	title
	created_at
	completed_at

Next, identify the relationships between our nouns:
A User has many Tasks
A Task belongs to a User

Next, declare what column types these attributes will be:
User
	id - Integer, Primary Key
	email - Varchar(64)
	password - Varchar(64)
	name - Varchar(64)
Task
	id - Integer, Primary Key
	title - Varchar(64)
	created_at - Datetime
	completed_at - Datetime
	user_id - Integer

(Notice the addition of the user_id field to represent the relation)

Next, take our definition and build database tables from it:
Regarding naming conventions: the table name is a capitalized, plural version of the thing it represents.
